3.Mathematically derive the average runtime complexity of the non-random pivot version of quicksort.

Best-case time complexity: 
O(nlogn),As array is already sorted , we assume the pivot divides the array into two equal halves.
Average-case time complexity: 
O(nlogn),for random arrays assuming the pivot divides the array in a balanced way on average.
Worst-case time complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛2), As array is reverse sorted,the pivot selection leads to unbalanced partitioning.
